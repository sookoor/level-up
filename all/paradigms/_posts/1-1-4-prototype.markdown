title: Write an application in a prototype-based language

Javascript seems to be the only really widespread prototypal
language. While I use lots of javascript, more often than not it's
wrapped up in jquery, and I barely touch the prototypal aspects of the
language. Once I write a framework using the prototypal aspects of the
language, then I'll mark this off.
